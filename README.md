# wheel-of-fortune-vue

## Inspiration and credits

Part of this project is based on [Wheel of Fortune (React)](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/wheel-of-fortune-1475d).
I adapted and rewrote the original code in Vue.js, including some changes and custom adjustments for my project.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
